# SFUGG `Elmer/Ice` Learning Resources  

This website is not intended to be a comprehensive `Elmer/Ice` documentation.
For that see the [`Elmer/Ice` Wiki](http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php),
[`Elmer` forum](http://www.elmerfem.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=21),
[`Elmer Solver`](http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerSolverManual.pdf), and
[`Elmer Model`](http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerModelsManual.pdf) documents.

Instead this website is intended for internal SFUGG use to share tips on getting `Elmer/Ice` installed,
resources for learning `Elmer` and help solving group specific problems.
